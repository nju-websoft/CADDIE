# CBDS
Data, source codes and experimental results for paper "*[From Metadata to Content-Based Dataset Search](https://github.com/nju-websoft/CBDS)*". 

> The rapid growth of open data published on the Web has promoted fruitful research and development of dataset search systems. Current implementations mainly exploit the metadata of datasets to support ad hoc dataset retrieval. However, metadata contains limited information and often suffers from quality issues. Therefore, Content-Based Dataset Search (CBDS) is demanded to exploit the actual data to provide users with search results featuring higher relevance, lower redundancy, and better explainability. In this vision paper, we systematically introduce CBDS and identify its advantages, research tasks, and challenges. We ground our vision in Caddie, a prototype of content-based ad hoc dataset retrieval over RDF datasets, and we empirically demonstrate its effectiveness and feasibility. Finally, we discuss potential impacts of CBDS to users, researchers, developers, and data providers.
